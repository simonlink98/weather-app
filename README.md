# Weather-App

🧙🏽‍♀️💬
We developed this app because we use everyday services like Google Weather, Apple Weather, or similar apps to plan our lives...and get tanned properly. None of us were really satisfied with what they provided so we made it our mission to develop the best weather app in the world ~~and steal Google's customer~~. In the process we thought about additional services that would be interesting for surfers and vacationers. This resulted in the functions of tides, sun course, as well as wind.
We wanted these data to be displayed quickly and clearly. The logical consequence was a user menu that responds to the content and geographical wishes of the user.

We hope you like it!


# Manual

Before launching the app in the Jupyter, please make sure to copy all files in the "Images" folder into the folder where your Jupyter Notebook is stored.

Using the OpenWeather API, we built the "weather app 3000" that emulates the Google weather application.

The user is able to navigate through an amazing custom menu of 5 choices.

1. Forecast 24h


The user receives a plotted overview of the most relevant data such as temperature over time, the main weather condition and sun. 💯

2. Forecast 4 days

For the lazy ones who just want to know what the weather will be like and how warm it is going to get. Meh. 🦦

3. Tides

For all those mates who want to ride a wave. Booyah! 🤙

4. Sunrise / Sunset

Sunset chasers of the world. This is all you need. Know when your favorite fireball shows up and when it is going to disappear. 🌞

5. Wind

For all those sitting on a sailing boat waiting till the "🎶 row row row your boat 🎶" misery is over... 🌬

6. Exit

We do not think anyone would ever want to leave the glorious weather loop, but if you need to - feel free, (traitor). 💩
